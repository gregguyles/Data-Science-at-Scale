#1. Examples of Data Science
## 2012 election
- state polls have predictive power
- getting the answer may be the easy part but there is difficulty in sharing and presenting results
- simple methods are usually best when analyzed with enough good data
   - this trumps more sophisticated methods
- Obama campaign's data driven ground game
  - use SQL database for analytics
    - Vertica - use for fast "Speed of thought" queries
  - Hadoop used as well for aggregated generations

## Hurricane Sandy
- twitter data used to follow power outages
- weather data pulled from the web used to show barometric pressure over time
   - illustrates the "Ad hoc" application of data science
   - wind speeds graphed as well

## Text data analysis
- Google has already broken all 20th century books in to a table of n-grams
- mood scores produced by wordnet
- researchers have combine these resources to produce mood analysis in literature
- analysis of a z-sore of (Joy - Sadness) showed a dip towards sadness after WWII
- emotion - random words showed a decrease in emotion over time while showing an increase of fear words
- Sourced from resources such as linguistics, anthropology, history are becoming hard sciences because of the ability of Data Science
   - all Science is becoming Data Science
- for large data sets (i.e. wiki leeks) users will want analysis to show trends

## determining importance
- page rank
   - method of rating importance by showing how many links there are to site
- analytics on graph of citation network
- show the joining of biology and neurology to form neuroscience
   - Bibliometrics

## other examples
- induce a graph on the ingredients of recipes
   - build and analyze this graph to find clusters
- last.FM set used to identify genres over time
   - repurposed data originally used for search
- Google trends finding flu outbreaks by looking at search words 
   - far over estimated 2013 flu
   - the media attention on the flu skewed the results
   - biased data
- Microsoft research - side effects of drugs
   - results gained by monitoring web search traffic
   - correlated search of drugs and a unknown side effect
- 6 Italian seismologist convicted of manslaughter for failing to predict earthquake
  - when you make a prediction you are putting weight behind it

# Summary
- graph analytics
- databases
